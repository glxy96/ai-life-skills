> [!prompt]- Agent Instructions
> A one-page daily news digest. Pick the **single most important story** from each topic. One item per topic — quality over quantity.
>
> **How to use**
> 1. Edit the topic list below to whatever you actually care about.
> 2. To run an update: ask the agent "update my daily news" — it will web-search each topic, pick the top story, and prepend a new day entry.
> 3. To run on a schedule, use `/schedule` (cloud) or `/loop` (local recurring).
>
> **Topics (customize freely):**
> 1. **AI** — model releases, research, product launches, regulation
> 2. **Tech** — major company news, product launches, layoffs, M&A
> 3. **Macro** — markets, oil, gold, FX, central banks, crypto
> 4. **World** — geopolitics, wars, diplomacy, disasters
> 5. **Local** — replace with your country/city
> 6. **<your interest>** — sports, anime, science, whatever
>
> Any topic can be in a non-English language if that's what you read in. Just say so in the topic line (e.g. "JP — write in Japanese", "TW — write in 繁體中文").
>
> **Callout types — most items should be grey:**
> - `[!note]` = default. Use for MOST items. Grey.
> - `[!breaking]` = truly major, once-a-week level (war escalation, market crash, paradigm-shifting launch). Yellow.
> - `[!critical]` = historic/unprecedented, once-a-month at most (nuclear strike, regime change, currency crisis). Red.
>
> Heuristic: if you'd tell a friend "hey did you see this?" → `[!note]`. If you'd call them → `[!breaking]`. If it'd be on every channel all day → `[!critical]`.
>
> **Rules:**
> - Each callout title starts with a topic tag: `AI:`, `Macro:`, `World:`, etc.
> - Title = tag + one-line headline (under 80 chars) + source in parentheses
> - Body = 2–4 sentences, short paragraph form, ending with `[Source](url)`. No bullet lists.
> - All callouts collapsed by default — use `[!type]-` (with the dash)
> - Newest day at the top, after this prompt callout
> - Group days under `## YYYY-MM` month headers
> - Day heading: `### [[MM-DD-YY Day]]` (e.g. `### [[03-29-26 Sun]]`)
> - When inserting a new day, collapse the previous day into a `> [!note]- [[date]]` callout (prefix all its lines with `> `)
> - Pick ONE story per topic. Skip a topic only if genuinely nothing happened.
> - Search multiple sources per topic — don't rely on a single outlet.
> - Set `unread: true` and update `updated:` in frontmatter when adding entries.
>
> **Format each day EXACTLY like this:**
> ```
> ### [[03-29-26 Sun]]
